# difference between a while loop and a for loop

# with while loop, once the condition is being met, the code runs
## for for loop, the code can only run if the variable is an iterable e.g array, strings

## There is no do while loop in python


fruits = ["fruit", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  

while len(fruits)>3:
  print("great")
